**Overview**
Welcome to the Carbon Footprint Tracker! This web application is designed to empower users to actively monitor and reduce their daily carbon emissions. By utilizing Flask, HTML, Python, SQL, Jinja, and Matplotlib, we have created a platform that not only calculates carbon footprints but also encourages users to reflect on their environmental impact and make informed decisions.

Technologies Used

Flask: The web application is built using Flask, a lightweight and modular web framework for Python.
HTML and Jinja: HTML is used for creating the structure of web pages, while Jinja templating engine is employed for dynamic content rendering.
Python: The backend logic and data processing are implemented in Python.
SQL: The project utilizes SQL for database management, storing user data securely.
Matplotlib: Graphs showcasing individual carbon footprint trends are generated using Matplotlib.
